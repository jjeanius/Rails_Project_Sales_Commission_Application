The Retail Sales Commission System is designed for a small sales force with a limited and simplified compensation plan structure. This application helps companies to track employee’s sales performance and calculate commission.

The following are some of the guidelines for my application:

1)	The application is based on my own work experience which I have incorporated into the application’s functionalities;

2)	The application incorporates the CRUD principle and it tracks sales and calculate commission; 

3)	The application is flexible so as allow the user to incorporate business rules and updated base and the company’s objective.  Presently, my application is based on the financial asset management business but can be easily adapted to other business models (e.g., expanding sales staff or adding new products).
